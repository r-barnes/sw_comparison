<h3>Changes in UGENE v. 33</h3>
<p>
    The new version introduces a bunch of improvements for adding a custom tool
    into UGENE: tighter integration of your tool with UGENE,
    enhanced wizard for creating a workflow element for the tool, etc. See details on
    the <a href="http://ugene.net/changelist.html">UGENE web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
    If you work with multiple sequence alignments, check out a new color scheme
    "Percentage Identity (colored)".
</p>
<p>
    And if you do NGS data analysis, watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FORI6rDqT00">new video</a> about
    quality control of the data.
