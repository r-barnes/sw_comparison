- [x] Refactor Directory Structure
	-[x] Separate source and header code
		- [x] Write descriptive comments in the header files
	- [x] Add clean headers to all files (license, authors, name, ifdef/ifndefs, ...)
	- [x] Change seed from c-style to c++-style (struct -> class and member funcs)
	- [x] Change score from c-style to c++-style (struct -> class and member funcs)
	- [x] Maybe reformat vectoruniontype to become a class
		- [x] We could move the ops into the vector class

- [ ] Core code
	- [x] Give the phases more descriptive names
	- [x] Use namespaces
	- [ ] Add tracing to the state
	- [ ] Optimize max search (from conversation with Colin MacLean)
		- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9795529/how-to-find-the-horizontal-maximum-in-a-256-bit-avx-vector
		- Logical AND it with the vector to get 1s in the maximum positions
		- Then AND that with a vector with one side one's and one side 0's, to test which half it's on
		- Then compare that vector to zero to decide what to do
		- That's a version for doubles, but the same strategy should work for bytes. It'll take a few more 		          instructions but there should be a divide and conquer approach to it. Find the maximum of 16 pairs, then 8, 			4, and 2.
