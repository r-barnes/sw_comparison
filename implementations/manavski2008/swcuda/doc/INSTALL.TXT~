To compile SmithWaterman-CUDA ensure you have QT4 
development libraries installed (http://www.trolltech.com) 
and cuda 1.1 or later ( hhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_get.html ) 
installed on your workstation

Then download the project package ( gpubiotools-xx.tgz ) 
from http://bioinformatics.cribi.unipd.it/cuda/downloads 
You need to extract it and compile according to the following instructions.

The user manual in pdf format is available in the "doc" 
sub-directory of the gpubiotools/swcuda


To compile libkrlcuda.a and libgpubiolib.a
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. go in the directory cudakernels under the home directory of the project
2. fix the paths in the compilation script comp_cu.sh
3. ./comp_cu.sh (to run the compilation script for the CUDA kernels) 
4. go in the directory gpubiolib under the home directory of the project
5. fix the paths in gpubiolib.pro according to your environment
6. qmake-qt4 (to create your Makefiles automatically)
7. make
8. you should find your compiled library in the same folder


To compile SmithWaterman-CUDA :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. go in the directory swcuda/src under the home directory of the project
2. fix the paths in src.pro according to your environment
3. cd .. ( to go to the project directory)
4. qmake-qt4 (to create your Makefiles automatically)
6. you should find your compiled binary in the swcuda/bin directory under the project 
   source tree
