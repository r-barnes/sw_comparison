	                     MASA-Serial extension
	                 
What is it?
===========

The MASA-Serial extension is used with the MASA architecture to align biological
sequences in a generic CPU. This extension can also be used as an example to 
create other extensions in new hardware/software architecture.


Compiling
=========

The simplest way to compile the project is to use the following commands:

   ./configure
   make

More information can be found in the INSTALL file.
   
   
Executing
=========

The default command line parameters are inherited from the MASA-Core, but
new parameters were added by the MASA-Serial extension. You can see all the 
parameters passing the --help argument.


Downloading
===========

The source code of this project can be downloaded from the git repository:

   git clone https://github.com/edanssandes/MASA-Serial
   
Before compiling the project, execute the autoreconf script:

   autoreconf --force --install
   
   
Development
===========

We recommend to read the MASA doxygen documentation before creating any new
feature or extension.

The libs/masa-core directory contains the MASA-Core code. We recommend
NOT to change the content of this directory to avoid conflict with the 
MASA-Core's master track.

To pull the last changes of the MASA-Core, use the following commands:

   ./git-pull-subtrees.sh https://bitbucket.org/edans/masa-core.git

The libs/masa-core directory was created using the git-subtree command.
If you are copying this extension and want to create a git repository, we
suggest the following commands:

   find . -type f | grep -i .git | xargs rm
   rm -rf libs/masa-core
   git init
   git add --all
   git commit -m'Initial Commit'
   git subtree add --prefix libs/masa-core \
                   https://bitbucket.org/edans/masa-core.git master --squash
   autoreconf --force --install

If you need to change the name of the classes, don't forget to change the
name of the source files in the Makefile.am. The .project file may also be
changed.
