Swsharpout is a post-processing tool for swsharp library. It is usefull because
often a lot of different post-processing is needed once a long running alignment
is done.

usage: swsharpout -i <alignment file> [arguments ...]

arguments:
    -i, --alignment <file>
        (required)
        input binary file of the alignment generated by the 'dump' output format
        by other swsharp modules
    --out <string>
        default: stdout
        output file for the alignment
    --outfmt <string>
        default: pair-stat
        out format for the output file, must be one of the following: 
            pair      - emboss pair output format 
            pair-stat - combination of pair and stat output
            plot      - output used for plotting alignment with gnuplot 
            stat      - statistics of the alignment
            dump      - binary format for usage with swsharpout
    -h, -help
        prints out the help
