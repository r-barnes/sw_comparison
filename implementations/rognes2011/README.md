Smith-Waterman database searches with inter-sequence SIMD parallelisation

SWIPE is a tool for performing rapid local alignment searches in amino acid
or nucleotide sequence databases. It is a highly optimized implementation of
the Smith-Waterman algoritm using SIMD parallel computing technology available
on common CPUs.

The method and a performance evaluation is described in detail the following
