Smith-Waterman
================

Smith-Waterman is a descendant of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for computing
local alignment between two sequences. Smith-Waterman requires all negative
values in the output scoring matrix to be reset to zero, which effectively
truncates non-beneficial paths through the matrix. See ../nw/README for a
description of the Needleman-Wunsch global sequence alignment algorithm.


Running
-------

Usage: swat [<platform> <device> | <type> --] <queryFile> <dbFile> [<openPenalty> <extensionPenalty> <workGroups>]

    queryFile           :filename of query sequence
    dbFile              :filename of sequence database
    openPenalty         :penalty to open a gap (Default: 5.0)
    extensionPenalty    :penalty for gap extensions (Default: 0.5)
    workGroups          :number of OpenCL work-groups to request (Default: 14)

	<platform>	:integer ID of platform to use
    <device>    :integer ID of device in <platform> to use
    <type>		: device type to use (0:CPU, 1:GPU, 2:MIC, 3:FPGA)	
    
Example:

    #aligns query1K1 against sampledb1K1        
    swat query1K1 sampledb1K1
    
    #aligns query2K2 against sampledb2K2 with modified open penalty
    swat quary2K2 sampledb2K2 10.0 0.5 14

Notes:

    The "workGroups" parameter, including the default of 14, is only a request.
    The algorithm requires workGroups be <= the number of compute units on the
    device, and is automatically scaled downwards if necessary.
