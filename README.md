Smith-Waterman Implementation Comparison
========================================

This repository contains material for comparing the performance of
implementations of the [Smith-Waterman
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm),
widely used as a step in genome sequencing.



Selection Criteria
========================================

A "good" implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for our purposes must
possess the following properties.

  1. Able to run on a GPU
  2. TODO



Candidate Implementations
